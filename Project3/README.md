# Caliber-v2.0
Caliber is a performance management suite to collect and analyze evaluations of Revature trainees. Trainers can input grades and feedback for each of their trainees. The quality department can input their evaluations on the batch of trainees. Trainers and quality personnel can comment on a trainee's profile. The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data. Users can generate individual and batch PDF reports to distribute to clients, trainees, and other stakeholders.

## Roles / Responsibilities
* Updated the application to use a MicroService approach rather than the previously existing Monolithic architecture.
* Used Angular 7, HTML and CSS to match the styling and functionality of the previously existing Caliber website.
* Implemented separate modules for the application which allowed the user to be routed to the correct page.
* Created services which performed HTTP requests.
* Retrieved HTTP responses as observables and mapped them to models within Angular.
* Designed dropdown menus to display different views depending on the user's selection.
* Created pagination functionality by week as part of the toolbar on the Quality Assessment page.
* Implemented input validation by having a modal appear asking the user if he or she was sure of their chosen option.
